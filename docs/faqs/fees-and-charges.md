# Fees and Charges FAQ

## Credit Card Fees

### What is an annual fee and can it be waived?
An annual fee is charged yearly for card membership. Many cards offer:
- First year waiver
- Waiver with minimum spend (e.g., $10,000/year)
- Permanent waiver through SingSaver promotions
- Waiver upon request (call the bank and ask!)

**Pro tip**: Most banks will waive annual fees if you call and ask, especially if you're a good customer.

### What is a late payment fee?
Charged when you don't pay at least the minimum amount by the due date:
- Typical amount: $100
- Also affects your credit score
- May trigger interest on entire balance

### What is a finance charge?
Interest charged on unpaid balances. In Singapore:
- Typical rate: 25-28% p.a.
- Calculated daily on outstanding balance
- Avoid by paying full balance monthly

### What is a cash advance fee?
Charged when you withdraw cash using your credit card:
- Fee: 5-8% of amount (minimum $15-20)
- Interest starts immediately (no grace period)
- Higher interest rate than purchases
- **Recommendation**: Avoid cash advances if possible

### What are foreign transaction fees?
Charged when you spend in foreign currency:
- Typical fee: 2.5-3.5%
- Applies to overseas purchases AND online purchases in foreign currency
- Some cards offer lower or no foreign transaction fees

### What is an overlimit fee?
Charged if you exceed your credit limit:
- Typical fee: $40-50
- May also decline the transaction
- Can affect credit score

## Personal Loan Fees

### What is a processing fee?
A one-time fee charged when your loan is approved:
- Typical range: 1-3% of loan amount
- Often waived through SingSaver promotions
- Deducted from loan disbursement or added to loan

### What is an early repayment fee?
Charged if you pay off your loan before the agreed tenure:
- Typical fee: 2-3% of outstanding balance
- May include an admin fee ($100-200)
- Calculate if early repayment still saves money overall

### What is a late payment fee for loans?
Charged when you miss a monthly installment:
- Flat fee: $50-100
- Plus interest on overdue amount (often 3% per month)
- Affects credit score significantly

### What is the difference between flat rate and EIR?

**Flat Rate**:
- Simple calculation: Interest % x Principal x Years
- Doesn't account for reducing balance
- The rate you see advertised

**EIR (Effective Interest Rate)**:
- True cost of borrowing
- Accounts for monthly repayments reducing principal
- Always higher than flat rate
- Required by MAS to be disclosed

**Example**:
- 5% flat rate over 3 years ≈ 9.5% EIR
- Always compare EIR, not flat rates!
