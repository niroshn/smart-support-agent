# Personal Loan Basics FAQ

## What is a personal loan?
A personal loan is an unsecured loan from a bank or financial institution that you repay in fixed monthly installments over a set period. Unlike a mortgage or car loan, it doesn't require collateral.

## How much can I borrow?
Loan amounts in Singapore typically range from $1,000 to $250,000. The maximum you can borrow depends on:
- Your annual income
- Existing debt obligations
- Credit score
- The lender's policies

### MAS Guidelines
The Monetary Authority of Singapore limits unsecured borrowing:
- Income < $20,000: Max 2 months' income
- Income $20,000-$120,000: Max 4 months' income
- Income > $120,000: No regulatory cap (bank's discretion)

## What are typical interest rates?
Personal loan interest rates in Singapore range from 3.5% to 12% p.a. (flat rate). Factors affecting your rate:
- Income level (higher income = lower rate)
- Loan tenure (shorter tenure = lower rate usually)
- Credit score
- Existing relationship with the bank

## What's the difference between flat rate and EIR?

### Flat Rate
- Calculated on the original loan amount
- Simpler to understand
- **Lower number** than EIR

### Effective Interest Rate (EIR)
- True cost of the loan
- Accounts for monthly principal repayment
- **Always higher** than flat rate
- Required for comparison by MAS

### Conversion Rule of Thumb
EIR ≈ Flat Rate × 1.8 to 2.0

Example: 5% flat rate ≈ 9-10% EIR

## How do I calculate my monthly repayment?

### Formula (Approximate)
Monthly Payment = (Principal + Total Interest) / Number of Months

### Example: $30,000 loan at 5% flat for 3 years
- Total Interest = $30,000 × 5% × 3 = $4,500
- Total Repayment = $30,000 + $4,500 = $34,500
- Monthly Payment = $34,500 / 36 = $958.33

## What can I use a personal loan for?
Common uses include:
- **Debt consolidation**: Combine multiple high-interest debts
- **Home renovation**: Upgrade your HDB or condo
- **Wedding expenses**: Cover ceremony and honeymoon costs
- **Medical bills**: Pay for treatments not covered by insurance
- **Education**: Fund courses or children's education
- **Emergency expenses**: Unexpected major costs
- **Major purchases**: Furniture, electronics, etc.

## Should I use a personal loan or credit card?
| Factor | Personal Loan | Credit Card |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Interest Rate | 3.5-12% p.a. | 25-28% p.a. |
| Best For | Large, planned expenses | Small, short-term needs |
| Repayment | Fixed monthly | Flexible |
| Discipline | Forced savings | Requires self-control |

**Rule of thumb**: If you can't pay off the credit card within 3 months, consider a personal loan instead.

## How long should my loan tenure be?
| Tenure | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| Short (1-2 years) | Less total interest | Higher monthly payments |
| Medium (3-4 years) | Balanced | Moderate interest |
| Long (5+ years) | Lower monthly payments | More total interest |

### Example: $50,000 loan at 5% flat rate
| Tenure | Monthly Payment | Total Interest |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| 2 years | $2,292 | $5,000 |
| 3 years | $1,528 | $7,500 |
| 5 years | $1,042 | $12,500 |

## What happens if I miss a payment?
1. **Late fee**: $50-100 immediately
2. **Additional interest**: 2-3% on overdue amount
3. **Credit score impact**: Reported to credit bureau after 30 days
4. **Collection calls**: Bank will contact you
5. **Legal action**: For prolonged non-payment

**If you're struggling**: Contact the bank immediately. Most will offer:
- Payment holiday
- Tenure extension
- Reduced payment arrangements

## Can I pay off my loan early?
Yes, but check for early repayment penalties:
- Typical fee: 2-3% of outstanding balance
- Plus admin fee: $100-200
- Calculate if the interest savings exceed the penalty

### Example: $30,000 remaining, 2% early repayment fee
- Penalty: $600
- If remaining interest is $1,500, you save $900

## Will applying affect my credit score?
Each loan application creates a "hard inquiry" on your credit report:
- Single application: Minimal impact
- Multiple applications (within 30 days): Moderate impact
- Many applications over time: Significant negative impact

**Recommendation**: Research and compare rates on SingSaver first, then apply to 1-2 lenders only.

## How do I compare loans effectively?
1. Always compare **EIR**, not flat rate
2. Include all fees (processing, insurance)
3. Calculate total cost of loan
4. Check for SingSaver exclusive rates and promotions
5. Consider the bank's reputation and service
