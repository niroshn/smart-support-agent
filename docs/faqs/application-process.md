## Why was my application rejected?

### Common Reasons
1. **Income below requirement**: Each product has minimum income criteria
2. **Poor credit score**: Late payments or defaults affect your score
3. **Too many recent applications**: Multiple applications in short time is a red flag
4. **High existing debt**: Debt-to-income ratio too high
5. **Incomplete documents**: Missing or unclear documents
6. **Employment issues**: Job hopping or probation period

### What to Do If Rejected
1. Wait 3-6 months before reapplying
2. Check your credit report at Credit Bureau Singapore
3. Pay down existing debts
4. Ensure stable employment
5. Consider products with lower requirements

## Can I apply for multiple cards at once?
Technically yes, but we don't recommend it because:
- Each application creates a credit inquiry
- Multiple inquiries can lower your credit score
- Banks may view it as desperate for credit
- **Recommendation**: Apply for 1-2 cards at a time, wait 3-6 months between applications

## How do I cancel an application?
Contact the bank directly:
- Call their hotline
- Visit a branch
- Use online chat/email
- Applications can usually be cancelled before card issuance

## What is an in-principle approval?
An in-principle approval (IPA) means the bank has preliminarily approved your application based on initial checks. Final approval depends on:
- Document verification
- Credit bureau check
- Final underwriting review

Not all IPAs result in final approval, but most do.

## Do I need to be employed to apply?
For most products, yes. However, some options exist for:
- **Students**: Student credit cards with lower limits
- **Freelancers**: With proof of income (invoices, bank statements)
- **Retirees**: With CPF/pension income or fixed deposits
- **Homemakers**: Supplementary cards on spouse's account
